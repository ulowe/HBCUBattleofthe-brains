As a fan, it can sometimes be difficult to fully engage and enjoy the experience of being at a stadium during a live NFL game. For example, it is challenging for a fan sitting up high in the nosebleed seats to watch and engage like a fan sitting closer to the field. This limits fan engagement and can often leave them feeling left out. Moreover, during halftime, fan engagement loses its intensity because the players are in the locker room. There must be a way to keep fans engaged throughout the game, including halftime. While also furthering engagement with at-home fans who cannot attend games.
To overcome this challenge, we created a new all-inclusive featured app, Front Row, that enhances the fan experience. The app further enhances the experiences of those at the stadium and brings the front-row seat experience to those watching the game in their living room. Additionally, it gives fans access to player statistics, data, players' social media platforms, and favorite charities to further establish a more intimate experience with players. Our fans will also have the weekly option of voting for up to six players, three from each opposing team, to be "mic'd" up during games.
